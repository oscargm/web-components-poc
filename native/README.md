# Native web components

The code in this folder is an example picked up from [Pascal Schilp](https://github.com/thepassle/webcomponents-from-zero-to-hero)

I only added [OWC Dev Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/owc-dev-server) to make life easier.

To be able to run the example just type in your terminal:
```bash
npm i && npm start
```
and that's it.
