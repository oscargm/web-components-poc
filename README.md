# Web components Proof of concept

The main goal of this repository is to get a working component with different frameworks.
With that, with one implementation you can get a component for:

- Native
- React
- Vue
- Svelte
- Angular

Each framework has it's own folder. To get it working:

```bash
cd ./fwk-folder && npm i && npm start
```

## Current status

- Native <span style="color:green">Working</span>
- React <span style="color:red">Not Working</span>
- Native <span style="color:red">Not Working</span>
- Native <span style="color:red">Not Working</span>
- Native <span style="color:red">Not Working</span>
